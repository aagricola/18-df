## Today
- Look at 3D prints
- Take photo and upload it to your Assignment 2 folder
- CNC demo
- Setting up toolpaths
- 30-45 minutes to draw your CNC assignment
- Pair up and set toolpaths
- Cut!
- Begin working on Project 1, thinking, making sketches and modeling in Rhino

## CNC Assignment

- Make a shape that fits comfortably within 12" x 12"
- Draw or write something simple in that shape using only 2D lines and curves (keep it simple to save time)
- Pair up with the person sitting next to you and combine your files so that they both fit on a 24" x 48"  piece of plywood that is .47" thick (don't trust me though; measure for yourself)
- Work together as you set up toolpaths (two heads are better than one). One person can set one toolpath and one can set another.
- Create a toolpath to cut the perimeter shape profile out completely using the 1/4" Compression tool
- Create a toolpath to engrave the interior word or drawing .08" deep using the 1/4" ballnose tool

## Project 1

Make a sculpture/installation/object using two out of the three machines learned so far in class. You must incorporate one found or previously made object or material. Two out of the three objects should nest or fit together snuggly. There are examples from last semester in today's download examples folder.

## Homework

- Complete your cut on the CNC if you did not in class. Either come during homework hours. The tech on duty or Ryan McKibbin should be able to help you if they are not busy with other work, or schedule a time for me to come help you. Take a photo and put it in your folder
- Review [RhinoCAM 2015 Mill Reference](https://mecsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RhinoCAM_2015_MILL-Reference_Sample.pdf)
- Optional reading if you really want to understand CNC operations better: [Six Key Concepts Needed to Master CNC Programming](https://www.pmpa.org/docs/default-source/technical-conference/pdf-handout83ead2ae46706df9a22bff0000aff8c6.pdf?sfvrsn=0)
- REMINDER: PROJECT WORK WEEK NEXT WEEK. I will be gone, but I expect you to still come to the lab to work on your project. By 3:30pm on the 27th, I would like for you to send me a project statement, a screenshot or saved image of what you did in Rhino that day, as well as any questions that may have popped up. **This email that you will send is how I will count your presence and participation for that day!** Caleb will be a tech on duty if you need immediate help, but I will also try to be available by email as much as possible.
