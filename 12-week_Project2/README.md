## Project 2

Project two should involve a process of moving from some physical input to digital and then back to a physical output. If you find that you would like to reverse that flow, it's ok to go from digital to physical to digital. I encourage you to use grasshopper, doing self guided research, and building on what you have learned so far. Using at least one tool learned this semester is required.
