## Assignment
- Choose four from a [randomly generated list of words](http://listofrandomwords.com/index.cfm?blist)
  1. draw a word linearly using poly-lines, arcs, and primitives combined with trim, join, and other curve editing tools
  2. draw a word in cursive, using the “curve: interpolate points” command along with manipulating the control points
  3. create a stencil of a word in a geometric, but smooth style
  4. create a stencil of a word in an organic rough style that looks hand-drawn

- all letters should be 2.5″ tall or a little smaller
- keep all 4 words in one file
- export an image of your file and upload

## Homework
- [sign up for your research topic](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fU6xdk104XwCqqKSILNh7tnoo4Kkht-vqVfxvgFonjI/edit?usp=sharing)
- read the [dFab Studio manual](http://staff.mica.edu/rmckibbin/Images/Manual.pdf) and be sure that you, understand,  and agree to all of this information.
- [Rhino 5 tutorials on Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/Rhino-tutorials/Rhino-5-Essential-Training/133324-2.html)
Ch 1-5  –  interface and workflow (this part is a little slow, but has useful information)
Ch 6  –  2D modeling (you may begin assigned 2D rhino exercise after completing this section)
Ch 7-10  – 3D modeling
- Bring to class a small (fist-sized or a little smaller) relatively simple object for object copy exercise
- Don't forget your headphones
