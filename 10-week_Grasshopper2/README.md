  - Lists
  - Data Trees
  - Manipulating data

## Assignment

  - Create 3 GH files with each definition containing unique:
    - Geometry components
    - Sequence component (Series, Range, Random, etc)
  - Explore the effect of changing the data structures (Graft, Flatten, etc)
    - use Panels and/or Param Viewers to see the data structure
    - observe the effect it has on your geometry and note it in your file using Panels, group labels, or the Scribble tool
    - organize your definition
      - avoid crossing wires as much as possible
      - align things to make the flow easier to read
      - place items in groups and give those groups descriptive labels
      - if a classmate were to open your file, she should be able to readily understand everything happening in it
  - upload .gh files to your folder

## Homework

- Finish assignment and upload to your folder
- Review what we covered today in []“Working With Data Trees” tutorial ch 1-7](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGV167zE8gnV-mffyzD3mDhOrSM-CXaYW)
- Optional to continue with chapters 8-14 (recommended)
