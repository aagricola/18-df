## Today

- student research presentations
- discuss reading
- Grasshopper
  - Lists
  - Data Trees
  - Manipulating data

## Project 2

Project two should involve a process of moving from some physical input to digital and then back to a physical output. If you find that you would like to reverse that flow, it's ok to go from digital to physical to digital. I encourage you to use grasshopper, doing self guided research, and building on what you have learned so far.

## Assignment

  - Create 2 GH files with each definition containing unique:
    - Geometry components
    - Sequence component (Series, Range, Random, etc)
  - Explore the effect of changing the data structures (Graft, Flatten, etc)
    - use Panels and/or Param Viewers to see the data structure
    - observe the effect it has on your geometry and note it in your file using Panels, group labels, or the Scribble tool
    - organize your definition
      - avoid crossing wires as much as possible
      - align things to make the flow easier to read
      - place items in groups and give those groups descriptive labels
      - if a classmate were to open your file, she should be able to readily understand everything happening in it
  - upload .gh files to your folder

## Homework

- Project proposal
- Review what we covered today in [“Working With Data Trees” tutorial ch 1-7](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGV167zE8gnV-mffyzD3mDhOrSM-CXaYW)
- Optional to continue with chapters 8-14 (recommended)
- Finish assignment and upload to your folder
- If you have an Arduino, bring it next week
